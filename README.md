# Computer Graphics
The following repository contains a set of four homeworks of incremental difficulty that I worked on for a Computer Graphics exam held by Prof. Fabio Pellacini in my university.
Each homework dealt with a different aspect of computer graphics and tasked students with the devolpment of image modifiers, raytracing shaders, procedural modeling and physical simulation. All homeworks were written in C++ using Yocto/GL, credits at the end of this ReadMe.

This set of homeworks scored 30 out of 30 during evaluation.

# Homework 1 - Image Manipulation  
The first homework deals with the manipulation of images, applying filters and transformations on a pixel level. Few filters were requested as base credits for the completion of the first homework, though I implemented some extra credits functions that included a Predator Thermal Vision, a Gaussian Blur filter and a Cross-Hatching filter.    
# Homework 2 - Raytracing  
The second homework deals with the rendering of scenes through raytracing, to study the interactions between rays and different materials in a scene. Particular attention was put into the rendering of reflections and refractions.  I implemented two extra credit functions that included a refraction behavior in glass materials and a Wet/Metalizzed shader that would give the scene a "rainy" mood. Interstingly enough the shader changes hair materials into crystals.  
# Homework 3 - Procedural Modeling  
The third homework deals with procedural modeling to study the "application" of textures and model manipulation through a procedural calculation of the scene. Base credits ranged from a haired bunny to a noise generation on a spherical surface.  I implemented two extra credits functions that would apply a basic density control when generating hair and two instances of procedural noise: Cell Noise and Smooth Voronoi.  
# Homework 4 - Animation and Simulation  
The fourth homework deals with animation, specifically with two physics simulation methods, namely mass-spring and position-based. Base credits requested simulations of a set of balls falling to the ground, a cloth being unraveled and the interaction between said cloth and a bunny put in its way.  I implemented an extra credit function that would add a completely controllable wind effect that would push the piece of cloth tailwind or upwind, with different force that can be set through command line.
